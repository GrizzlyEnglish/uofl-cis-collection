# CIS 199

## Lab One
This lab explores the use of Visual Studio to create a simple GUI application.

## Lab Two
This lab explores the use of Visual Studio to create a simple GUI application with textboxes and string concatenation.

## Lab Three
This lab explores the use of Visual Studio to create a simple GUI application with numeric input, calculations, and output formatting.

## Lab Four
This lab explores the use of Visual Studio to create a simple GUI application with decision making and use of fields.

## Lab Five
This lab explores the use of counter-controlled repetition using while, for, and do-while loops and TryParse for validation. The GUI includes use of radio buttons, a list box, an accept button and a cancel button.

## Lab Six
This lab explores the use of nested loops in a Console application.

## Lab Seven
This lab explores the creation of a value-returning method. Preconditions and postconditions will also be introduced.

## Lab Eight
This lab explores the use of methods and simple arrays.

## Lab Nine
This lab explores the use of Visual Studio to create a project that involves a class and a Form.

## Program One
Calculate the amount of paint needed to paint walls with a simple calculator application

## Program Two
Determine if a student is able to register courses based on UofL scheduling

## Program Three
An extension of Program Two, now determine the date and time the student can register for classes.

## Program Four
Ship packages back and forth between locations. Determine cost based on size of package.

# CIS 200

## Lab One
This lab explores the use of LINQ to query an array of objects.

## Program 1 - 3
A simple parcel shipping application. Each program builds on the last. Implementing classes to doing LINQ.

## Program 4
Also part of the parcel shipping application; but was a bonus comparator introduction.

This repository will serve as a location for all the code made during my time at the Univeristy of Louisville. I will admit, I had prior
skill in programming before attending UofL for my degree. So, most Labs/Programs you see in here will be a little more 'off the books'.
